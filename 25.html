    <h1>&lt;meta&gt; tag gives information About Your Pages</h1>

    <p> The &lt;meta&gt; element lives
        inside the &lt;head&gt; element and
        contains information about that
        web page</p>
    <p>
        It is not visible to users but
        fulfills a number of purposes
        such as telling search engines
        about your page, who created
        it, and whether or not it is time
        sensitive. (If the page is time
        sensitive, it can be set to expire.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The &lt;meta&gt; element is an empty
        element so it does not have a
        closing tag. It uses attributes to
        carry the information.
    </p>
    <p>It has two attribute <strong>name</strong> and <strong>content</strong></p>
    <p>The value of the <strong>name</strong> attribute
        can be anything you want it to
        be. Some defined values for this
        attribute that are commonly
        used are:</p>
    <p>
    <h4>description</h4>
    This contains a description
    of the page. This description
    is commonly used by search
    engines to understand what the
    page is about and should be a
    maximum of 155 characters.
    Sometimes it is also displayed in
    search engine results.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>keywords</h4>
    This contains a list of commaseparated words that a user
    might search on to find the page.
    In practice, this no longer has
    any noticeable effect on how
    search engines index your site.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>robots</h4>
    This indicates whether search
    engines should add this page
    to their search results or not. A
    value of noindex can be used if
    this page should not be added. A
    value of nofollow can be used
    if search engines should add this
    page in their results but not any
    pages that it links to.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The &lt;meta&gt; element also
        uses the http-equiv and
        content attributes in pairs.
        In our example, you can see
        three instances of the httpequiv attribute. Each one has a
        different purpose:</p>

    <p>
    <h4>author</h4>
    This defines the author of the
    web page.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>pragma</h4>
    This prevents the browser from
    caching the page. (That is,
    storing it locally to save time
    downloading it on subsequent
    visits.)
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>expires</h4>
    Because browsers often cache
    the content of a page, the
    expires option can be used
    to indicate when the page
    should expire (and no longer be
    cached). Note that the date must
    be specified in the format shown.
    </p>

    <div>
        <p>A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small yet important image that appears next to your website’s
            title in the browser tab. Also known as a tab icon or bookmark icon, it helps users quickly identify and
            return to your site. Studies show that over 85% of users rely on visual cues like favicons to recognize
            websites they trust.</p>

        <h4>They are used for several key purposes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Size: usually 16×16, 32×32, or 48×48 pixels</li>

            <li>Format: .ico (most compatible), or .png, .svg, .jpg</li>

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Brand Recognition: They act as a visual marker that supports brand awareness.</li>
            <li>Professionalism: A well-designed favicon makes your site appear more credible.</li>
            <li>Usability: It enhances user experience by making it easier to locate your tab among many open ones.</li>

        </ul>
    </div>
