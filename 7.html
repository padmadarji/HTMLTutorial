	<h1>HTML5 &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt;</h1>
	<h2>HTML5 &lt;figure&gt;</h2>
	<p>Images often come with
		captions. HTML5 has introduced
		a new &lt;figure&gt; element to
		contain images and their caption
		so that the two are associated.
	</p>
	<p>You can have more than one
		image inside the &lt;figure&gt;
		element as long as they all share
		the same caption.</p>
	<h2>&lt;fig caption&gt;</h2>
	<p>The &lt;fig caption&gt;element has
		been added to HTML5 in order
		to allow web page authors to add
		a caption to an image.</p>
	<p>Before these elements were
		created there was no way to
		associate an <img> element with
		its caption.</p>
	<p>Older browsers that do not
		understand HTML5 elements
		simply ignore the new elements
		and display the content of them.</p>
