	<p>There are lots of occasions when we
		need to use lists. HTML provides us with
		three different types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Ordered lists(Numbered lists)</b> are lists where each item in the list is
			numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
			a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
			where each point needs to be identified by a section
			number</li>
		<li><b>Unordered lists(Bullet lists)</b> are lists that begin with a bullet point
			(rather than characters that indicate order).</li>
		<li><b>Definition lists(Definition lists)</b> are made up of a set of terms along with the
			definitions for each of those terms</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
		<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
			minutes until tender</li>
		<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
		<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
		<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1kg potatoes</li>
		<li>100ml milk</li>
		<li>50g salted butter</li>
		<li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
		<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Definition Lists</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Sashimi</dt>
		<dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with
			condiments such as shredded daikon radish or
			ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
		<dt>Scale</dt>

			weight of ingredients</dd>

		<dt>Scamorzo</dt>
		<dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole

	<h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
	<p>Here is a simple and versatile recipe for a Vegetable Mayonnaise Sandwich, a quick, creamy, and healthy option
		for a snack or light meal. It can be enjoyed as a cold sandwich or lightly toasted/grilled. </p>

		<li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion</li>
		<li>1/4 cup finely chopped capsicum (bell pepper)</li>
		<li>1/4 cup finely chopped carrot (or shredded)</li>
		<li>2 tbsp sweet corn (boiled, optional)</li>

			corn.</li>
		<li>Add seasoning: Add salt and black pepper powder to the vegetables.</li>
		<li>Mix with mayonnaise: Add the mayonnaise to the vegetables and mix everything well until the vegetables are
			evenly coated.</li>
		<li>Assemble the sandwich:

			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Serve:

					(skillet), in a sandwich maker, or a panini press until golden brown and crispy on both sides. </li>
