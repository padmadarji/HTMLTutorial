    <h1>What is HTML? </h1>
    <p>HTML Hyper Text Markup Language</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML pages are text documents.</li>
        <li>HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
            brackets) to give the information they surround special
            meaning.</li>
        <li>Tags are often referred to as elements.</li>
        <li>Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes</li>
        the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
        the end.</li>
        <li>Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
            about the content of that element.</li>
        <li>Attributes require a name and a value.</li>
    </ul>
